# pytorch-examples
> Minimum viable examples of machine learning models in PyTorch. 

The goal of this project is to produce minimum viable examples for common machine learning models in pytorch. By minimum viable, we mean a very minimal implementation of the model just to show a working example.

## Models 

- **MLP image classifier**: `mlp.ipynb` on Fashion MNIST 
- **CNN image classifier**: `cnn.ipynb` on imagenette-imagewoof
